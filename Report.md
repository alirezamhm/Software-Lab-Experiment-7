## 1. Facade

For this refactoring task we have to decrease coupling for different packages used in the project (although there isn't really any coupling happening here!). For this purpose, we add a Facade class called _SymbolFacade_ in the _semantic.symbol_ package. Then, anywhere that we need to have a _SymbolTable_ or _Symbol_ object we use this class.

Created _SymbolFacade_ and changed _CodeGenerator_.

## 2. State/Strategy

In this task we have to change an conditional statement with polymorphism. We will create three subclasses for _Action_ class called _Shift_, _Reduce_, and _Accept_. Then we override the _toString_ function in each of them instead of using switch case statement.

changed _ParseTable_ and _Action_ and added _Shift_, _Reduce_, and _Accept_.

## 3. Separate Query From Modifier

In this refactoring technique we have to change a function that returns a value but also changes something inside an object to two separate functions. We changed _getTemp_ function in memory to two different functions, the first one create required space for the temp and second one will return the last temp space.

changed _Memory_ and _CodeGenerator_.

## 4. Self Encapsulated Field

For this technique, we have to change a private field to have getter and setter.

changed _LexicalAnalyzer_.

## 5. Inline Method

We can remove obvious methods and use its content itself. For example, in _CodeGenerator_ we can remove _lastSymbolBool_ function and replace it with its content.

changed _CodeGenerator_.

## 6. Extract Method

We can extract some code fragment that can be put into a separate function. For example in _Rule_ class some part of the constructor can be changed into a separate function called _createRHS_.

changed _Rule_.


# Questions

## 1.

* Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. It is a reader-focused development style that produces software thatâ€™s easy to write, read and maintain.
* Technical debt is the cost of additional rework caused by choosing the quickest solution rather than the most effective solution.
* Smelly code is a code that is difficult to understand and maintain. Code smells are patterns in the source code of a program that indicate a deeper problem or bad design.

## 2.
* **Bloaters:**
  Bloaters
  Bloaters are code, methods and classes that have increased to such gargantuan proportions that they are hard to work with. Usually these smells do not crop up right away, rather they accumulate over time as the program evolves (and especially when nobody makes an effort to eradicate them).
* **Object-Orientation Abusers:**
  All these smells are incomplete or incorrect application of object-oriented programming principles.
* **Change Preventers:**
  These smells mean that if you need to change something in one place in your code, you have to make many changes in other places too. Program development becomes much more complicated and expensive as a result.
* **Dispensables:**
  A dispensable is something pointless and unneeded whose absence would make the code cleaner, more efficient and easier to understand.
* **Couplers:**
  All the smells in this group contribute to excessive coupling between classes or show what happens if coupling is replaced by excessive delegation.

## 3.
* Dispensables.
* Inline class and Collapse hierarchy.
* When we want to delineate intentions for future development.
